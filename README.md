# Figma Wishlist

## Base App

* Being able to simulate CSS's "inline-block". Ex. I want to be able to have an icon component follow a line of text that wraps.
* Allow border offset to simulate CSS's "outline-offset"
* Be able to resize right side panel. (Hard to read long variable names.)
* Use booleans for more than just layer visibility (Ex. Change autolayout direction for stacking buttons vertically)
* Allow jumping to pages by name using the quick search (Cmd+P)
* More granular control of nested properties. (Would like only to expose *some* properties from a nested component.)
* Better UI for nested properties in panel. (Maybe indentec? Allow expanded/collapsed by default.)
* Allow custom bullets in lists
  
### Variables
  * Import/export to JSON! (I'm sure this'll come one day)    
  * Resize columns widths
  * Let user control size of window (note: double clicking white space above "name/value" column makes it fullscreen.
  * More granular controls of private variables. I've like to have a private collection of primatives that don't get published, but I do want them to be exported or available to plugins.
  * Search within variables window
  * When variable value is an alias, let me be able to jump/link to that alias token
  * When search for variable names, allow search by value too
  * Let variables set component properties
 
## Plugins
* Take a component and build a page with every instance of variation/permutation possible with the properties (to validate design)
    * Bonus points for using different lengths of strings (to test wrapping, clipping, etc.)

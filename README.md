# Figma Wishlist

* Being able to simulate CSS's "inline-block". Ex. I want to be able to have an icon component follow a line of text that wraps.
* Variables
  * Import/export to JSON! (I'm sure this'll come one day)    
  * Resize columns widths
  * Let user control size of window (note: double clicking white space above "name/value" column makes it fullscreen.
  * More granular controls of private variables. I've like to have a private collection of primatives that don't get published, but I do want them to be exported or available to plugins.
  * Search within variables window
